# Event Sourcing Cart Application

This Java Spring Boot application demonstrates an implementation of event sourcing for a shopping cart with a PostgreSQL DB table.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/main/java`: Java source code.
  - `com.example.cartservice`: Main package for the cart service.
    - `CartEvent`: Entity representing events related to the cart.
    - `Cart`: Class handling the state of the cart and logic for processing events.
    - `CartItem`: Class for cartItems in Cart class.
    - `CartEventController`: REST controller for handling cart events.
    - `CartEventService`: Service layer for managing cart events.
  - Other packages and classes for supporting the application.

- `src/main/resources`: Configuration files and resources.
  - `application.properties`: Application configuration.

- `pom.xml`: Maven project configuration.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-sourcing-cart.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd event-sourcing-cart
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The application will start, and you can access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

### Add Cart Event

- **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/cart/{customerId}/events`
- **Method:** POST

    "itemId": 123,
    "itemName": "Example Item",
    "quantity": 2,
    "price": 19.99
  }
  ```
- **Output:** Status code `201` (Created)
